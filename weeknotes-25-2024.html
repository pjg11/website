<h2 id="smol-pr-victory">Smol PR victory</h2>

<p>I submitted <a href="https://github.com/robinovitch61/wander/pull/138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a PR</a> for wander, which got merged! I came across a similar bug recently, so the fix in terms of code was simple.</p>

<p>Understanding the codebase was the tougher part, which the project’s maintainer (and fellow Recurser) very kindly walked me through in a chat.</p>

<h2 id="blog-post-struggles">Blog post struggles</h2>

<p>I thought publishing these weeknotes would make writing other posts easier. I was wrong.</p>

<p>I don’t feel like pushing through it either, I’ve sort of lost interest. Maybe having the code in a repo + a README is sufficient? Let’s see.</p>

<h2 id="ctf-adventures">CTF adventures</h2>

<p>A group of Recursers decided to participate in <a href="https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google CTF</a> over the weekend! I hadn’t played a CTF in a while, so my skills were rusty (they were basic to begin with). And Google CTF in particular is tough, where even the “easy” challenges are not that easy.</p>

<p>I fell into a rabbit hole with one of the challenges, and that path wasn’t helpful in solving it AT ALL :/</p>

<p>Regardless, the rabbit hole was really interesting. I started looking into terminal escape sequences, a combination of characters that allow for functionality in the terminal - printing text in different colors being an example.</p>

<p>I was particularly interested in terminal injection - using certain sequences in a way that lets me execute shell commands. Turns out that wasn’t possible (the code was escaping the escape sequences), but I left with a better understanding of how it works.</p>

<p>Here are some links I found helpful:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>

<p>Did I work in a more structured way than usual? Not really, but I had one big win: I didn’t fall down the “maintaining my website” rabbit hole! I decided on this earlier in the week, and I’m happy I’m stuck to it.</p>

<p>I’ve also realized that there are times I’m learning things that don’t feel useful in the moment, but help me in another situation.</p>

<p>For example, the bug fix for wander was something I came across in one of my personal projects. I dropped that project mid-way, so it wasn’t particularly useful there. However, having worked on that code helped me figure out the exact fix in this case, which was cool.</p>
