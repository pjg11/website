<h1>Now</h1>

</p>
<p>I had some success writing blog posts since my last update in September 2024. I installed Linux on a spare MacBook, and learnt a lot just from setting that up! I was able to maintain a weekly-ish cadence throughout September, but again found myself struggling to keep up in October.</p>

<p>I travelled for the first time in six years for a family wedding in November, and it was the much needed reset I needed. I realized how much I’d gotten stuck in a loop with certain habits, and traveling helped me break through those. The biggest shift I made was to step outside at least once almost every day, and that has been helping a ton.</p>

<p>I also started thinking of ways of establishing a good blogging routine, and I saw a tweet from a fellow Recurser, <a href="https://x.com/itseieio/status/1866656952442597453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nolen</a> who was joining another batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=2ac66128b9116e0722d941ebf7e14b5a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recurse Center</a>. I tend to be extremely low on motivation in the winter months, so I thought another batch might provide the structure I was looking for.</p>

<p>I’m currently 4 weeks into batch, and I’m working on the things I’d started working on in September, but figuring out how to scope them better this time. One thing I worked on that I’m really proud of is <a href="https://github.com/pjg11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZulipFS</a>, a blog post about which should be out pretty soon!</p>
