<h2 id="jamming-to-songs-on-loop">Jamming to songs on loop</h2>

<p>There are phases where I don’t actively jam to music, but rather just play it in the background while working. I was in this phase for a while, until I heard two new songs last week and now I can’t stop jamming to them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azhwDQsYD8c&amp;pp=ygURcGl5YSBwaXlhIGNhbGxpbmc%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piya Piya Calling</a> by Karpe, Kaifi Khalil and Amanda Delara feat. Quick Style - I’ve been following Quick Style for a while and have heard a song or two from Coke Studio Pakistan, but I never expected their collaboration to be a song with my name in the title. Such a feel good track.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Ue-LN5B9U&amp;pp=ygUKYWFzYSBrb29kYQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aasa Kooda</a> by Sai Abhayankar and Sai Smriti - The chorus and hook step blows my mind every.single.time. The music video is also really beautifully filmed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I wanted to add these songs to my playlist, so I spent some time refactoring a script I wrote to download songs locally with their metadata. It was fun looking back at messy code from 2 years ago.</p>

<h2 id="letting-go-of-tuntcp">Letting go of tuntcp</h2>

<p>I think I got what I wanted out of <a href="https://github.com/pjg11/tuntcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tuntcp</a> a long time back, but perfectionism kept coming in the way, so I kept adding/changing stuff and now I don’t know where to stop.</p>

<p>Progress has been slow, and I’m loosing interest. This coming week is the last week I’ll work on refactoring the code, after which I’ll consider the project done.</p>

<h2 id="reflecting-on-one-year-at-rc">Reflecting on one year at RC</h2>

<p>I got accepted to the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=2ac66128b9116e0722d941ebf7e14b5a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recurse Center</a> in July last year, but my batch started on August 7th, which means its officially been a year since I joined!</p>

<p>The batch felt like the tip of the iceberg in terms of my capability as a programmer. However, I find myself only slightly lower from the tip a year later, unable to go deeper on one/a few topics.</p>

<p>I worked on projects post-batch too, but those where chosen based on what I found fun in that moment, rather than learning things in a structured way. More on this later.</p>

<p>A pleasant surprise came in the form of the opportunity to work as a part-time moderator. Helping maintain a community that has been a subtle support system for the past year feels good (so does having some source of income while I figure how to make this “making stuff online” thing work).</p>

<p>To top it all off, my <a href="/rc07">end-of-batch statement</a> was added to the list of <a href="https://www.recurse.com/who" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RC’s Testimonials</a> recently, which felt really nice! This might be the first time my blog has been linked somewhere.</p>

<h2 id="planning-ahead">Planning ahead</h2>

<p>The last few weeks were hectic, and with those commitments now over, I’m ready to focus on projects again. Reflecting on my time at RC got me thinking on how I can change my approach to learning. Here are some half-baked ideas to ponder over this week:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I make a study curriculum for myself and follow it as much as I can. I’ve stayed away from structured learning for the longest time, but maybe I’m ready for it now?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I try out the things Julia Evans wrote about during her <a href="https://jvns.ca/#recurse-center-2013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2013 batch at RC</a> as a starting point. I’ve hesitated to do this for two main reasons:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Someone already figured this stuff out 11 years ago, so I feel dumb figuring this stuff out 11 years later, even though the concepts are new to me. I know its a silly reason, which is why I’d like to get over this.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If I end up writing about it, I fear my posts will end up looking like clones of hers, particularly if I don’t have anything new to add.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Starting some kind of daily writing practice, where I attempt at writing some blog-post like every day privately. Ideas include trying to explain a concept or a passage of a book and writing setup guides for things I use commonly. Some of these might turn into actual blog posts someday.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have some <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-self-directives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finger work projects</a> to fall back on. Challenges like <a href="http://protohackers.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protohackers</a> help keep the programming momentum going as I’m presented with a set of requirements, and I only have to focus on the implementation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
