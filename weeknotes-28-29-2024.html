<h2 id="working-on-tuntcp">Working on tuntcp</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pjg11/tuntcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tuntcp</a> is a project I started during my batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=2ac66128b9116e0722d941ebf7e14b5a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recurse Center</a>. It started off great, but I lost interest by the time the batch ended.</p>

<p>Since then, completing this project has been at the back of my mind. I tend to lose interest whenever I pick it up again - I either get too ambitious about what features to include, or get stuck on how to structure the code.</p>

<p>I made some progress about 2 months ago, but the code was so hackily put together that I myself get confused if I look at it just a few days later.</p>

<p>Over the last two weeks though, I think I made some sort of breakthrough. I’ve been working on this locally, so nothing to show publicly yet.</p>

<h2 id="completed-raytracingweekend">Completed raytracingweekend</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pjg11/raytracingweekend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raytracingweekend</a> has been complete for a while, but I kept the README brief at the time in the hopes of writing a longer blog post about it.</p>

<p>The motivation to write a post never came, so I decided add some more details to the README and call it a day.</p>

<p>I’ve been avoiding doing this for months. And when I finally started, it took me under an hour to complete. Fun</p>

<h2 id="re-starting-protohackers">Re-starting Protohackers</h2>

<p>I heard about Protohackers from a fellow Recurser, and attempted a few challenges at the start of this year. As happens with projects, I start them with full interest, but lose momentum at some point and leave it.</p>

<p>A few weeks/months later the interest comes back, and I make an attempt to finish it with any new knowledge I’ve learnt since then.</p>

<p>That happened this weekend with Protohackers. I started solving them in Go, and completed 3 challenges! The code is up <a href="https://github.com/pjg11/protohackers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>

<p>Surprisingly, I made some pretty good prioritizing decisions over the last two weeks.</p>

<p>Since my attention is currently divided by multiple commitments, I decided to work on/finish existing projects, as it’s easier to get started and keep the momentum going.</p>

<p>I joined a few RC study groups, but found myself skipping most of them. Rather than trying to fit them in, I chose to stop attending all of them except one, that I host.</p>

<p>I also switched to posting a weeknote once every two weeks, to account for the slower pace for the meantime.</p>
