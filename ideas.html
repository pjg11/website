<p>If any of these ideas particularly interest you, let me know!</p>

<details>
<summary>Debugging a segmentation fault the hard way</summary>

Inspect a core dump instead of print debugging

</details>

<details>
<summary>How does Linux boot, really?</summary>

Dissecting the kernel logs to see how the kernel boots. Doesn't include bootloader loading (not sure if that would be too much to include).

</details>

<details>
<summary>What processes does my machine run on start up, and can I kill it?</summary>

Inspired by [Can you kill it? Ubuntu Server startup processes](https://peteris.rocks/blog/can-you-kill-it). Should I be checking `systemd` services instead of `htop` though? There are a lot of processes that do start, but don't appear in the list as they've stopped.

</details>

<details>
<summary>PATH management</summary>

I discovered this while seeing some paths on my macOS machine, and I didn't know where they came from. I've written a post about managing user specific paths in [How To View and Update the Linux PATH Environment Variable](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-view-and-update-the-linux-path-environment-variable), but this covers `/etc/paths` and `etc/paths.d`.

</details>
<details>
<summary>How I manage my passwords</summary>

[KeepassXC](http://keepassxc.org) as the password manager, manually filling in passwords on websites, and a script to do so programmatically.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Print camera output to the framebuffer</summary>

I came across [Writing To The Framebuffer](https://seenaburns.com/2018/04/04/writing-to-the-framebuffer/) a while ago, and thought it would be cool to print the output of my camera instead of an image. Good way to explore the `/dev` directory.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Automating my macOS setup</summary>

- Install packages via `brew` and `mas` (maybe Brewfile?)
- Dotfiles using Stow (maybe?) - `.zshrc`, `.config/`, `~/Library/Application Support`
- System settings via `defaults`
- Cron jobs to automate cleanup of application files that can be safely deleted - log files, caches

</details>
<details>
<summary>Confusing zsh shell options</summary>

I was setting shell options in my `.zshrc`, and found some confusing options relating to managing the history:

- `HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS`
- `HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS`
- `HIST_SAVE_NO_DUPS`
- `HIST_IGNORE_DUPS`
- `HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS`

It would be cool to see how each one behaves differently from the other and list which ones I ultimately ended up using.

<summary>Tools to analyze the baseline of my machine</summary>

To know what's wrong in a machine, I first need to know what it's normal state looks like. I want to explore some of the tools that help me find that, as well as the normal ranges for that thing.

A good starting point seems to be [Linux Performance Analysis in 60,000 Milliseconds](https://netflixtechblog.com/linux-performance-analysis-in-60-000-milliseconds-accc10403c55), linked in [SREcon: Performance Checklists for SREs 2016](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2016-05-04/srecon2016-perf-checklists-for-sres.html).

</details>
<details>
<summary>Something something <code>/proc</code></summary>

The proc filesystem looks really cool, and finding something cool about a process from it would be fun, like [Recovering files using /proc (and spying, too!)](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/03/23/recovering-files-using-slash-proc-and-other-useful-facts/). Maybe I should read the `man` page.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Finding where your app's data is being written to using `lsof`</summary>

I knew an app I used on macOS wrote to a SQLite database, but I didn't know where it was located. Using `lsof` helped me find that.

</details>
<details>
<summary>A <code>jq</code>-like tool, for HTML</summary>

There are existing tools out there for extracting HTML contents based on CSS selectors [htmlq](https://github.com/mgdm/htmlq), [pup](https://github.com/ericchiang/pup/) and [html-xml-utils](https://www.w3.org/Tools/HTML-XML-utils/README).

However, `jq` also allows to modify keys and values within JSON, which none of the tools do for HTML. I'm planning on switching to hand-crafted HTML pages instead of using a static site generator for my website, and a tool that lets me modify attributes and values for multiple elements at once would be really useful.
