<h1>Installing Ubuntu on a 2017 MBP - Power management</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-09-13">September 13, 2024</time>
</p>
<p>Continuing from the <a href="/mbp-linux-wifi">previous post</a>, there were two other issues I faced after installing Ubuntu:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The battery drained super quickly despite less usage</li>
  <li>The laptop would get warm and remain warm even when the system was idle</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn’t get any warnings regarding battery life or heat issues from the family member I got the laptop from, neither was I using the laptop enough for it to be this warm or use this much power.</p>

<p>Solving this wasn’t as straightforward as the fixing WiFi, becuase the searches didn’t lead to any one single solution. So I had to debug my way through this somehow.</p>

<h2 id="finding-a-starting-point">Finding a starting point</h2>

<p>I started by finding ways to see the temperature of my laptop, for which I found a package called <code>lm-sensors</code>. Before checking the temps, I ran <code>sensors-detect</code> and selected all of the default options.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>lm-sensors
<span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>sensors-detect</code></pre>

<p>When I ran <code>sensors</code> for the first time, there was too much output and it barely made sense. I spent some time deciphering the output, and then came the second problem - I didn’t know the ideal temperatures to know which ones were high.</p>

<p>So I tried a different approach. I decided to capture the <code>sensors</code> output twice - once after boot, and one 30mins after that - and compare the two. In those 30mins, I tried to keep the system idle or used it minimally.</p>

<p>This approach worked, as I saw a difference in <code>coretemp-isa-0000</code>, which shows the temperatures of the CPU cores:</p>

<div class="flex">
<figure>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-">coretemp-isa-0000
Adapter: ISA adapter
Package id 0:  +45.0°C
...</code></pre>

    <figcaption>After boot</figcaption>
  </figure>
<figure>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-">coretemp-isa-0000
Adapter: ISA adapter
Package id 0:  +55.0°C
...</code></pre>

    <figcaption>30mins after boot</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p><code>Package id 0</code> refers to the temperature of the CPU as a whole, and there is a 10 degree increase in about 30mins, with little to no activity in that duration.</p>

<p>I was off to search again, and I landed with two possible causes of this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Some process is hogging CPU</li>
  <li>Bad power management of Linux on Macs</li>
</ol>

<p>The first cause got eliminated pretty quickly, as <code>htop</code> didn’t show any process with a high CPU usage, and the CPU usage was also fairly low overall. Bad power management was a very common issue reported in online forums, and I knew my machine worked fine on macOS, so this seemed like a valid cause.</p>

<p>One of the tools I came across to enable better power management was <code>powertop</code>, that displays the energy usage of a system and offers default settings for better power management. I enabled the defaults using the <code>--auto-tune</code> flag after installing.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>powertop
<span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>powertop <span class="nt">--auto-tune</span></code></pre>

<p>When <code>powertop</code> is run without any flags, it runs in a similar fashion to <code>top</code>, displaying the energy usage and other statistics that update in real time.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-">The battery reports a discharge rate of:  14.5  W
The energy consumed was :  325  J
The estimated remaining time is 2 hours, 6 minutes

Summary: 123.1 wakeups/second,  0.0 GPU ops/seconds, 0.0 VFS ops/sec and 3.1% CPU use

          0.8 ms/s      21.0        Interrupt      [79] amdgpu
...</code></pre>

<p>Some things stood out here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The battery discharge rate seemed high</li>
  <li>As a result, the energy consumption was also high</li>
  <li><code>amdgpu</code> was second highest in the energy usage list</li>
</ul>

<p>The appearance of <code>amdgpu</code> seemed something to look into further, and saw that there was an option to disable it all together. I wasn’t planning on doing any heavy-duty work on this machine, so it seemed like a reasonable solution if it would help reduce temperatures.</p>

<p>I started following <a href="https://medium.com/codeflu/disabling-discrete-amd-graphics-card-in-linux-5d365738fc97" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this tutorial</a>, which first checks if you have two graphics on your system or not.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>lspci | <span class="nb">grep </span>VGA
<span class="go">01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Baffin [Radeon RX 460/560D / Pro 450/455/460/555/555X/560/560X] (rev ff)</span></code></pre>

<p>I don’t see a second GPU, but <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111947" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this machine</a> has two GPUs - an integrated GPU and a discrete/dedicated GPU.</p>

<p>OH WAIT, I found the root cause - the iGPU didn’t get detected for whatever reason, and the dGPU is being used as the main graphics driver in its place. The dGPU uses a lot of power, which explains the the high energy usage in <code>powertop</code>, the quick battery drain and the laptop getting warm!</p>

<p>Other people have also <a href="https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faced the same issue</a> and have documented solutions for it, which I followed along.</p>

<h2 id="enabling-the-igpu">Enabling the iGPU</h2>

<p>The iGPU is not detected thanks to the way Apple’s firmware works. If it recognizes that it’s booting an OS other than macOS, it will power down some of the hardware, the iGPU being one of them. Thanks Apple!</p>

<p>The TL;DR solution to this is to make the firmware believe that it is booting macOS by running custom code before boot.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-build-the-custom-efi-code">Step 1: Build the custom EFI code</h3>

<p>The custom code is available in the <a href="https://github.com/0xbb/apple_set_os.efi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apple_set_os.efi</a> repository. All I had to do was build the file.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>git clone https://github.com/0xbb/apple_set_os.efi

rm apple_set_os.o apple_set_os.so</span></code></pre>

<h3 id="step-2-move-the-code-to-the-boot-partition">Step 2: move the code to the boot partition</h3>

<p>Next, the code needs to be in a location that is accessible during boot, aka the boot partition. I can put the code in <code>/boot/efi/EFI</code> directly too, but the instructions I was following put this in a sub-directory called <code>custom</code> instead.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo mkdir</span> /boot/efi/EFI/custom
<span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo cp </span>apple_set_os.efi /boot/efi/EFI/custom</code></pre>

<h3 id="step-3-ask-grub-to-run-the-code-before-boot">Step 3: Ask GRUB to run the code before boot</h3>

<p>Placing the code in the boot partition alone isn’t enough, I needed to add instructions to run the code before boot somewhere. That somewhere is the bootloader configuration, which in this case is GRUB. I added the following lines to a file created for users to add custom configurations: <code>/etc/grub.d/40_custom</code>:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">cat</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="no">EOF</span><span class="sh"> &gt;&gt; /etc/grub.d/40_custom
</span><span class="go">search --no-floppy --set=root --file /EFI/custom/apple_set_os.efi
chainloader /EFI/custom/apple_set_os.efi
boot
EOF</span></code></pre>

<p>The GRUB menu display was disabled on my machine. To be able to debug any issues on boot, I made the following changes to <code>/etc/default/grub</code>:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-conf"><span class="c"># Comment the following line
# GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden
</span>
<span class="c"># Change the timeout value
</span><span class="n">GRUB_TIMEOUT</span>=<span class="m">10</span>

<span class="c"># Uncomment the following lines
</span><span class="n">GRUB_TERMINAL</span>=<span class="n">console</span>
<span class="n">GRUB_GFXMODE</span>=<span class="m">640</span><span class="n">x480</span></code></pre>

<p>Then I ran <code>sudo update-grub</code> to save the changes.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-switch-to-using-the-igpu-on-boot">Step 4: Switch to using the iGPU on boot</h3>

<p>This is done using a shell script called <a href="https://github.com/0xbb/gpu-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gpu-switch</a> that writes the required values to an EFI variable to use the iGPU. The changes were applied on the next boot, so I rebooted the machine.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>git clone https://github.com/0xbb/gpu-switch
<span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">cd </span>gpu-switch
<span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo</span> ./gpu-switch <span class="nt">-i</span>
<span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>reboot now</code></pre>

<p>After rebooting, the iGPU now appears in the <code>lspci</code> output!</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>lspci | <span class="nb">grep </span>VGA
<span class="go">00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation HD Graphics 630 (rev 04)
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Baffin [Radeon RX 460/560D / Pro 450/455/460/555/555X/560/560X] (rev ff)</span></code></pre>

<h2 id="disable-dgpu">Disable dGPU</h2>

<p>The dGPU continued to run and warm up the laptop despite the iGPU being detected, so I disabled it with the following commands:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">echo </span>OFF | <span class="nb">sudo tee</span> /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch
<span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>modprobe <span class="nt">-r</span> amdgpu</code></pre>

<p>And slowly, my laptop started to cool down. I checked the output of <code>sensors</code> after a while, and the temperatures were MUCH lower than with the dGPU enabled:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-">coretemp-isa-0000
Adapter: ISA adapter
Package id 0:  +42.0°C
...</code></pre>

<p>The <code>powertop</code> output also reflected this:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-">The battery reports a discharge rate of 7.60 W
The energy consumed was 151 J
The estimated remaining time is 8 hours, 35 minutes

Summary: 62.1 wakeups/second,  0.0 GPU ops/seconds, 0.0 VFS ops/sec and 0.7% CPU use

            Usage       Events/s    Category       Description
        100.0%                      Device         Audio codec hwC1D0: ATI
        491.8 µs/s      27.3        Timer          tick_sched_timer
...</code></pre>

<p>The battery discharge rate and energy consumption values were lower, battery life became longer and <code>amgdpu</code> no longer appeared at the top of the list!</p>

<p>Lastly, I created a systemd service to disable the dGPU on boot. Thanks to this, my machine remains cool throughout:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-systemd"><span class="c"># disable-dgpu.service</span>
<span class="k">[Unit]</span>
<span class="nt">Description</span><span class="p">=</span>Disable discrete GPU
<span class="nt">Before</span><span class="p">=</span>display-manager.service

<span class="k">[Service]</span>
<span class="nt">Type</span><span class="p">=</span>oneshot
<span class="nt">ExecStart</span><span class="p">=</span>/usr/sbin/modprobe amdgpu
<span class="nt">ExecStart</span><span class="p">=</span>/bin/sh -c 'echo OFF &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch'
<span class="nt">ExecStart</span><span class="p">=</span>/usr/sbin/modprobe -r amdgpu
<span class="nt">RemainAfterExit</span><span class="p">=</span>yes

<span class="nt">WantedBy</span><span class="p">=</span>multi-user.target</code></pre>

<p>I remember being scared when I noticed these issues for the first time. I’d been used to things “just working” on macOS and Windows, and this was the opposite of that. Going from a feeling of fear to slowly gaining the courage to fix stuff has felt great. I think I’m less scared now.</p>
