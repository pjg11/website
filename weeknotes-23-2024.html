<h1>W23 2024: Ebb and flow</h1>
<p><time datetime="2024-06-10">June 10, 2024</time>
</p>
<p>Last week, I felt like I gained superpowers with regards to making progress. This week, the superpowers vanished, poof.</p>

<h2 id="mission-website-revamp">Mission website revamp</h2>

<p>I decided to switch to another domain provider as my previous one was charging a higher price for renewal (happening a month from now). I initiated a domain transfer, which requires getting an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auth-Code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Auth Code</a>. It took 3 DAYS just to receive that.</p>

<p>I had a solid mental plan for this revamp, and this delay derailed that plan. This waiting period somehow forced me into waiting mode - I started avoiding other projects, even ones that weren’t related to the website. If I somehow got started on something, I couldn’t make progress and gave up.</p>

<p>I received the Auth Code on Friday and proceeded with the transfer, which should complete sometime in the coming week! With this the waiting mode faded away, and I picked up pace over the weekend.</p>

<p>I moved the hosting of this site from Netlify to <a href="https://github.com/pjg11/website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Pages</a>, and have been experimenting with a different theme + static site generator.</p>

<h2 id="a-cool-project-idea">A cool project idea?</h2>

<p>For some reason, my attention went to my Reading List this weekend. I have some pretty cool articles saved there, that I’ve either half-read or not touched at all.</p>

<p>I was thinking of ways how I could make the process more enjoyable, and I was reminded of times I used to annotate and write notes in the margins of textbooks in school.</p>

<p>Bringing that feeling online sounded like fun, and I started a <a href="https://web.hypothes.is" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hypothes.is</a> account to do so.</p>

<p>Hypothesis works really well, however it didn’t match the exact experience of writing notes in the margins. This spawned off a tiny project, which I’ll write about in a separate post. I do have some reflections about it to share here though.</p>

<p>Working on this project was a different experience than other stuff I’ve written. I was coding mainly in JavaScript (a language I don’t use very often) and I wasn’t too clear on the final result of the project. This sounds like the perfect recipe for failure - I change the scope too many times and eventually give up - and I was close.</p>

<p>However, I managed to take a step back, decide on a set of features, and posted a demo within the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=2ac66128b9116e0722d941ebf7e14b5a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recurse Center</a> community as a checkpoint. RC has been a supportive place to share stuff in an incomplete or not polished state, and I’d eventually like to get more comfortable doing so here on this blog.</p>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>

<p>As I’m writing this, I’m realizing this was actually a pretty standard week, but it felt a lot worse because I kept comparing with how the previous week went. I did do things, just not in the way I expected. And that’s okay.</p>

<p>On the other hand, managing to pull myself out of the “give up” stage of a project is not something I would usually do, so maybe I still have some superpowers left?</p>
