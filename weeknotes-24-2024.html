<h1>W24 2024: Slow but steady progress</h1>

<h2 id="impossible-stuff-day">Impossible Stuff Day</h2>

<p>Tuesday was <a href="/rc05#fn:1">Impossible Stuff Day</a> at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=2ac66128b9116e0722d941ebf7e14b5a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recurse Center</a>, so I took this as an opportunity to do something I’d been putting off for a while - cleaning the dust underneath the keys of my laptop by removing them.</p>

<p>It took about half a day - I started at around 5PM and ended at 1:30AM (with breaks of course). There was A LOT of dust in there.</p>

<p>My laptop was switched off the entire time, which meant I got lots of off-screen time aside from the occasional phone checks. I was TIRED by the time I was done, and the exhaustion continued into Wednesday as well.</p>

<h2 id="completing-cool-project-idea">Completing cool project idea</h2>

<p>I initially hoped to publish the code and write a post about it this week. However, getting the code to a publishable state took time as I basically ended up having to re-arrange and/or re-write parts of the code.</p>

<p>I did manage to fix some buggy parts of the code in the process, which was nice. I started drafting a post yesterday, and it should be up sometime this week.</p>

<h2 id="figuring-out-how-to-read-a-file-in-the-ext4-filesystem">Figuring out how to read a file in the ext4 filesystem</h2>

<p>I was reading an article from my Reading List - <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/series/reading-files-the-hard-way/part-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reading files the hard way - Part 3</a>. I’d learnt about aspects of the ext4 filesystem from different articles, but didn’t understand how they all connected together.</p>

<p>The latter half of the post explains this step by step through Rust code. Simply reading along was getting a little boring, so I decided it to port the code to C as I read the post!</p>

<p>I haven’t completed the post yet, but I progressed enough to understand how it all works! Also somewhat figured how to read Rust code along the way, so that was a plus!</p>

<h2 id="slow-progress-on-mission-revamp">Slow progress on mission revamp</h2>

<p>I fell down a theme rabbit hole, and came out of it liking my original theme once again! There were some elements of the redesign I liked though, so I’m slowly adding those changes in.</p>

<p>I didn’t even get to the static site generator side of things, so I’ll stick to my current setup for the meantime.</p>

<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>

<p>I generally tend to figure out what to do as the week progresses. This works for most things, except ones that take more effort to get started or aren’t as fun.</p>

<p>As I have a bunch of those kind of tasks right now (writing a blog post, completing mission revamp, finishing up projects that are close to done), I’m going to try being more structured this week and see how that goes.</p>
