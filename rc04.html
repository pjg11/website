<h1>RC04: Shell Scripting Adventures</h1>

<p>One of the things that helped me rediscover the joy of programming was making tiny shell scripts/functions for a specific purpose.</p>

<p>As I started using the command line more often, these functions helped execute commands that I would otherwise have to type repeatedly. And that set off a chain reaction - the more functions I made, the more ideas I’d get.</p>

<p>The first one I made was <a href="https://github.com/pjg11/scripts/tree/main/tzc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>tzc</code></a>, to convert time from another timezone to my local time. It was inspired by two things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The RC application process, where all the interview timings were displayed in EST, and I needed a way to convert timings quickly, and</li>
  <li><a href="https://lazybear.io/posts/cli-of-the-week-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLI of the week #19</a>, a post that introduced me to the idea of tiny shell functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things I like about making tiny functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://blubsblog.bearblog.dev/i-am-the-only-user/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I am the only user</a>, so I make them in a way that makes sense to me (bonus points if it makes sense to others too).</li>
  <li>It takes less time to go from idea to execution.</li>
  <li>It’s a great learning opportunity, as I end up learning something new about shell scripting concepts or the thing I’m making the script for.</li>
</ul>

<p>I made a couple of functions while at RC - particularly over the last two weeks - which I’ll share in this post.</p>

<h2 id="note"><code>note</code></h2>

<p>I came across <a href="https://github.com/cdkini/quicknote" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>quicknote</code></a> recently, and really liked the way it was structured. It made it easier to capture notes and search them, so I made its <code>zsh</code> equivalent:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-shell"><span class="c">#!/bin/zsh</span>
note<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">(</span>
    <span class="nb">dir</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/notes
    <span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$dir</span>
        
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nv">$1</span> <span class="k">in</span>
        <span class="s2">"open"</span><span class="p">)</span>    <span class="nb">shift</span> <span class="p">;</span> micro <span class="nv">$@</span> <span class="p">;;</span>
        <span class="s2">"ls"</span><span class="p">)</span>      fd <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nv">$dir</span> <span class="nt">--type</span> file | <span class="nb">cut</span> <span class="nt">-d</span><span class="s1">'/'</span> <span class="nt">-f5-</span> <span class="p">;;</span>
        <span class="s2">"grep"</span><span class="p">)</span>    rg <span class="nv">$2</span> <span class="p">;;</span>
        <span class="s2">"rm"</span><span class="p">)</span>      <span class="nb">shift</span> <span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">rm</span> <span class="nv">$@</span> <span class="p">;;</span>
        <span class="k">*</span><span class="p">)</span>         _usage <span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">;;</span>
    <span class="k">esac</span>
<span class="o">)</span></code></pre>

<p>A neat trick I learnt while making this is writing the function block in regular braces <code>()</code> - which runs commands in a subshell as opposed to curly braces <code>{}</code> - to prevent changing the directory of my current shell session.</p>

<p>The full code with error handling and usage information can be found <a href="https://github.com/pjg11/scripts/blob/main/note" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="blog"><code>blog</code></h2>

<p>This function is my take on a basic CLI content management system.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>blog <span class="nt">-h</span>
<span class="go">blog - commands to manage your Jekyll blog
        
Usage:
  blog command [args]

Options:
  -h|--help                  Show this message and exit
        
Commands:
  new filename               Create a new post
  update commitmsg           Build and deploy changes to existing content
  publish filename           Publish post now
  publish filename time      Schedule post for a later time
  preview                    View recent post/draft locally
  preview all                View entire website locally</span></code></pre>

<p>These commands have existed as a bunch of separate shell scripts and aliases. Some of them have featured on this blog - a <a href="/jekyll-blog-setup#publish-your-website#testing-the-script">publish script</a> and a post on <a href="/schedule-jekyll">scheduling</a>.</p>

<p>The upgraded function code can be found <a href="https://github.com/pjg11/scripts/blob/main/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rlist"><code>rlist</code></h2>

<p>I use Safari’s Reading List to save links, and I wanted a way to manage them from the command line, particularly to view all links and delete a link once I’m done reading.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console"><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>rlist <span class="nt">-h</span>
<span class="go">rlist - Manage Safari's Reading List from the command line

Usage:
  rlist [options] command

Options:
  -h|--help    Show this message and exit

Commands:
</span><span class="gp">  init         Extracts links and saves to $</span>HOME/notes/rlist.tsv
<span class="go">  search       Search all links and open chosen link in browser
  delete       Delete chosen link from list</span></code></pre>

<p>The Reading List is stored in <code>~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist</code>, and the function uses a utility called <a href="https://www.marcosantadev.com/manage-plist-files-plistbuddy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>PlistBuddy</code></a> to interact with the file.</p>

<p>Here’s a demo of the search command, that works like a fuzzy finder, along with the option to open the link in a browser.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/674173" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/674173.svg" alt="Thumbnail of an asciinema recording of the rlist's searching functionality" loading="lazy" /></a>
<figcaption>Click to view on asciinema</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is possibly the coolest script I’ve made yet, as it took a while to understand how <code>PlistBuddy</code> works, and using <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>gum</code></a> for the fancy formatting added to the coolness.</p>

<h2 id="mkfunc"><code>mkfunc</code></h2>

<p>Lastly, a meta function whose naming is inspired by <code>mkdir</code>. It creates a file with starter code for a shell function when called.</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-shell"><span class="c">#!/bin/zsh</span>

mkfunc<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="o">(</span> <span class="nv">$# </span><span class="nt">-eq</span> 0 <span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="o">(</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$*</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">=</span>~ <span class="s2">"-h"</span> <span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$*</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">=</span>~ <span class="s2">"--help"</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">]]</span> <span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then
            </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"Usage: mkfunc name"</span>
            <span class="k">return
    fi

    </span><span class="nb">tee</span> <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.oh-my-zsh/functions/<span class="nv">$1</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="no">EOF</span><span class="sh">'
#!/bin/zsh
    
func() {
    
    _usage() {
        # Add help text here
    }

    if [[ ( </span><span class="nv">$# </span><span class="sh">-eq 0 ) || ( "</span><span class="nv">$*</span><span class="sh">" =~ "-h" ) || ( "</span><span class="nv">$*</span><span class="sh">" =~ "--help") ]] ; then
        _usage
        return
    fi

    # Remove this block if function contains no subcommands
    case </span><span class="nv">$1</span><span class="sh"> in
        # Add other cases here
        *) echo "invalid option - </span><span class="nv">$1</span><span class="sh">" ; _usage ;;   
    esac
}
</span><span class="no">EOF
</span>    <span class="nb">chmod </span>u+x <span class="nv">$1</span>
    <span class="nv">$EDITOR</span> <span class="nv">$1</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre>

<p>This function contains simpler help text, as there are no additional commands. The heredoc delimiter <code>EOF</code> is wrapped with single quotes to prevent execution of the variables within the heredoc (<code>$*</code>, <code>$@</code>,<code>$1</code>).</p>

<hr />

<p>Thanks for tuning in to another episode of “things I didn’t plan to work on”! It’s interesting how I get more post ideas from side quests rather than the main ones 😅</p>
